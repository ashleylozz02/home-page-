        <h3>Did you Know?</h3>
        <p>Although noncitizen immigrants are as likely as citizens to work, 
          they are significantly more likely to be uninsured due to more limited access 
          to both public and private coverage. One in four children has an immigrant parent, and the majority of these children are citizens.

Noncitizen immigrants also faced risk of financial difficulties due to the pandemic, as many work in service industries, such as restaurants and food services, that suffered cutbacks during the early phases of the pandemic</p>
